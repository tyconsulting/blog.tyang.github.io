It's been so long since we had the last Experts Live event in Australia. The last Experts Live event I have attended was in March 2019 in Austin, USA. My good friend Daniel Mar was in the process of organising Experts Live Asia and Experts Live Australia for 2020, but unfortunately, due to COVID-19 pandemic, both events were cancelled.

I am very excited to announce that Experts Live Australia is back in 2023! The event will be held in Microsoft Sydney Office on 19th-20th 2023. This time, we are getting much needed support from Microsoft, and actually, most of the members in the organising committee are Microsoft employees. I am very honored to be part of the team. This is going to be the first in-person tech conference for me since the pandemic. I am really looking forward to it!

The call for speakers is now open, and so is the ticket sale.

If you are interested in attending the event, or submitting a talk, please head to the [Experts Live Australia website](https://expertslive.au/) for more details.

Hope to see you there! it's going to be fun!
