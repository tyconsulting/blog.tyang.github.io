It's been 6 years since last Experts Live Australia. COVID has changed how we work, live and socialising with each other. I'm glad to see that Experts Live Australia is coming back this year. Unlike previous events, this year, Microsoft Australia has kindly taken the initiative and is organising the event. I am very honoured to be part of the organising committee together with Microsoft's Sarah Young ([@_sarahyo](https://twitter.com/_sarahyo)), Alessandro Cardoso ([@cloudtidings](https://twitter.com/cloudtidings)), Orin Thomas ([@orinthomas](https://twitter.com/orinthomas)) and Steven Hosking ([@OnPremCloudGuy](https://twitter.com/OnPremCloudGuy)) . Instead of Melbourne, this year, the event is going to be held at Microsoft Sydney Office on 19th-20th September 2023.

The sessions have been shortlisted, we have started announcing the sessions and speakers this week. The full agenda will be announced soon. We have selected many great sessions from Microsoft employees and MVPs, covering wide range of topics. If you are interested in attending the event in person, please head to the [Experts Live Australia website](https://www.expertslive.au/) for more details.

For me, I will be presenting 2 sessions:

1. Co-presenting with Microsoft's [Ahmad Abdalla](https://twitter.com/ahmadkabdalla): **Introduction to [CARML](https://aka.ms/carml) and how it can help your organization adopt Azure Bicep and Infrastructure as Code (Level 300)**.
2. Solo session: Back to the basics - **Sharing my Tips and Tricks for using ARM REST APIs (Level 300)**
